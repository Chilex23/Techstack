# Techstack
An online marketplace for tech gadgets.
I built this platform as the requirement for completing my bootcamp programme at the Moat Academy For Software Developers.

#TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. I used HTML and CSS for the frontend design, while also using Boostrap, JQuery and Javascript for the interactivity and functionalities. 
2. For the Backend, I used Python with the Flask Framework for server-side scripting, I also used MySQL for my database design.
